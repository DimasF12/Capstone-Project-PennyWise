# About The Model :
Developed with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, our model predicts the savings trends from user.
The TensorFlow architecture is utilized in this model to build a robust machine learning pipeline for time-series forecasting. The model leverages TensorFlow's sequential API to stack layers, starting with LSTM layers for learning temporal patterns in sequential data, wrapped with bidirectional layers to improve context understanding. Dropout layers are incorporated to reduce overfitting, ensuring the model generalizes well on unseen data. TensorFlow's capabilities allow seamless integration of preprocessing, training, and evaluation processes, enabling efficient forecasting of daily savings and cumulative savings trends based on historical data.
